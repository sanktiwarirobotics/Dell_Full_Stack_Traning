jdk 1.5 Type Saftey of the Object
Type casting should not be required

Before Genreics we could store any kind of object in collection Now we force programmers to store only specific types of object


Advantage:
Type Safety-Hold only single type of object
Type Casting-not required- no need to cast the object
Compile time Checking-checked at compile time itself.

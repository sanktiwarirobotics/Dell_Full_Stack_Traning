Doubly LinkedList
Each node has pointers pointing to previous and next node
Doubly linked list can be traveres easily in forward and backward direction

you can easily add the new node by changing the pointer for delete,since you have to previous and next pointer, we dont need to 
traverse the whole llist to find the previous node opposite to the case of singlly linked list

Each elements of Linked List is called as NODE

one Disadvantage:
Since there is one extra pointer,additional memory is required to store the pointer along with the next pointer and data item

What is Thread?
thread is the most lightweight subprocess which is the smallest unit of process

CPU does not allocate any memory area to threads so treads save memory and context switching between threads takes very less time

New - when you create new instance of Thread before invocation of start method

Runnable - after invocation of start() but thread schedule has not selected yet
Running- running state when thread scheduler picks up the thread 
Non Runnable - When thread is still alive but not eligible to run
Terminated- dead state when run method exits or finishes.


Synchronization is a mechanism where we want only thread to access the shared resource at one point in Time

Rentrant Thread/Monitor
Threads or Monitors are re-enterant
Which meand thread can use same monitor or lock for diffrent synchronized method is called from another menthod

Adantages:
eliminates the possible of singkle thread dea

deadlock



Concurrency introduced the concept of execeterService as as higher level replacement if workuing with threads directly

executor are capable of running asynchronous task and can manage a pool of threads so we dont have to create anew thread manually
